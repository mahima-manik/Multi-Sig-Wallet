# Multi-Sig-Wallet

In this project, we create a multi-sig wallet. 

Here are the requirements:
1. Wallet has set of owners
2. Wallet can hold balance
3. Owner can propose or submit a transaction to the smart contract
4. Owner can approve and revoke approval of pending transcations
5. anyone can execute a transcation after enough owners has approved it

### Project Setup

1. Install Node, Solidity and Hardhat
2. Create a new folder called multi-sig-wallet and `cd` inside the folder. Initialize an npm project by running: `npm init`. Enter the details and it will create `package.json`.
```‚ûú  MultiSigWallet git:(master) ‚úó npm init
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.

Is this OK? (yes) yes

`package.json` will contain something like:
3. To install Hardhat, use the following command: `npm install --save-dev hardhat`
4. Created a new hardhat project by running `npx hardhat` in the project folder. If hardhat was not installed before, it will install `hardhat@2.12.6` or latest. Create an empty hardhat.config.js.

üë∑ Welcome to Hardhat v2.12.6 üë∑‚Äç

‚úî What do you want to do? ¬∑ Create an empty hardhat.config.js
‚ú® Config file created ‚ú®

You need to install hardhat locally to use it. Please run:

npm install --save-dev "hardhat@^2.12.6"
```

And then run `npm install --save-dev "hardhat@^2.12.6"` to add Hardhat to the npm project.

5. This completes basic setup. Now we can start writing smart contracts and compile it locally.
